### 2. Historical Company Performance

Baker Hughes has a long and complex history, marked by significant mergers, acquisitions, and strategic realignments. The current entity is largely a result of the 2017 merger between Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas, which significantly broadened its technological capabilities and market reach, though the integration process brought its own set of challenges.

*   **Pre-Merger:** Baker Hughes historically was a major player in oilfield services, known for its drilling, completion, and production technologies. GE Oil & Gas brought a robust portfolio in equipment, industrial services, and upstream/midstream/downstream solutions.
*   **Post-Merger (Baker Hughes, a GE company):** The period following the merger involved significant integration efforts, aiming to realize synergies and streamline operations. This phase also saw some divestitures to optimize the portfolio.
*   **Spin-off from GE (2019/2020):** Baker Hughes officially separated from General Electric, becoming an independent, publicly traded company again. This marked a new chapter focused on independent strategy and capital allocation, with an emphasis on technological innovation and market responsiveness.
*   **Performance Trends:** Historically, Baker Hughes' performance has been closely tied to the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry. Periods of high oil prices and increased drilling activity typically led to strong revenue and earnings, while downturns in commodity prices resulted in reduced demand for its services and equipment, impacting profitability. The strategic pivot towards diversified energy solutions is a response to these historical cyclicalities and the evolving energy landscape.
